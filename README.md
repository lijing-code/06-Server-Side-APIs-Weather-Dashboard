# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is about create a weather dashboard that allows a user to get the current weather and five days forecast weather when he/she enter a specific city in the US.
The challenge is to use a third-party APIs (Open Weather API) to acess their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This application can run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

What I've learned:

* Use fetch('URL') .then(function(response)) .then(function(data)) to retrieve third-party apis to manipulate.
* Use bootstrap css framework to style the page.
* Use jQuery to finish JavaScript page.
* 'background-image: linear-gradient(to left,rgb(4, 27, 88), rgb(48, 48, 231), rgb(75, 133, 241))' to add a progressive background color for rendering the title of the page.
